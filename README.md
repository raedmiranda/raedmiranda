### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer from Peru. I graduated from [UPN](https://www.upn.edu.pe/) with a Bach. in Computer Systems Engineering focusing on Software Engineering.
I do my best to achieve the proposed task and learn new technologies that contribute to the project.  

I'm a firm believer that... 

>  ✨✨ APIs play a crucial role in business growth and link technologies with companies. ✨✨<

That's why my main focus is to exercise APIs and microservices patterns to becoming a **software architect**.

### 💬 About me:
- Refactoring guy
- I prefer NET technologies for backend, REST or GraphQL for endpoints, and Angular or React for frontend, as you can see below:

### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer from Peru. I graduated from [UPN](https://www.upn.edu.pe/) with a Bach. in Computer Systems Engineering focusing on Software Engineering.
I do my best to achieve the proposed task and learn new technologies that contribute to the project.  

   >  ✨✨ *APIs play a crucial role in business growth and link technologies with companies.* ✨✨

I'm a firm believer in that, so my main focus is to exercise APIs and microservices patterns to become a **software architect**.

### 💬 About me:
- Refactoring guy
- I prefer .NET technologies for backend, REST or GraphQL for endpoints, and Angular or React for frontend, as you can see below:
